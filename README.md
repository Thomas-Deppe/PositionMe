# PositionMe
Indoor poistioning data collection application created for the University of Edinburgh's Embedded Wireless course. 

## Assignment 2
Here is our entire repository and code for assignment 2. We have included an extra trajectory in the video which makes
our video slightly longer than 20 minutes. If marking is strict and we will be penalised for going past the time 
please ignore the last 2 minutes of the video. We felt that the extra trajectory really highlighted some of our apps
successes and so included it as an appendix of sorts. Thank you for your understanding.
