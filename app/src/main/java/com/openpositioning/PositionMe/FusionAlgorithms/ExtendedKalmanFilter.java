/**
 * The ExtendedKalmanFilter class implements an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for real-time state estimation
 * in navigation systems, particularly for applications involving pedestrian movements. This implementation
 * adjusts and corrects the state of a user based on a combination of sensor inputs and predefined motion models.
 *
 * The filter integrates multiple sources of data including inertial sensors, GPS, and Wi-Fi to provide a refined
 * estimate of position and orientation. The class manages updates from asynchronous data sources using a HandlerThread,
 * ensuring that operations do not block the main application thread and maintain responsive performance.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Real-time prediction and updating of user state based on sensor data.
 * - Handling of various movement types with different noise characteristics.
 * - Opportunistic updates when new data arrives outside the typical update cycle.
 * - Recursive correction for continual refinement of the state estimate.
 * - Use of Wi-Fi and GPS data to enhance localization accuracy.
 * - Smoothing of positional data to reduce noise and improve the output consistency.
 *
 * Key Components:
 * - Fk (State Transition Matrix): Defines how the state changes from one time step to the next without considering the process noise.
 * - Qk (Process Noise Covariance Matrix): Quantifies the uncertainty in the process noise, updated based on movement characteristics and time.
 * - Hk (Observation Matrix): Maps the state space into the observed space, used during the update phase.
 * - Rk (Observation Noise Covariance Matrix): Represents the noise in the measurements, adjusted dynamically based on data source reliability.
 * - Pk (Estimate Error Covariance Matrix): Quantifies the estimated accuracy of the state estimates.
 * - Xk (State Estimate Vector): The estimated state of the system at each time step.
 *
 * Usage:
 * The ExtendedKalmanFilter is primarily used within systems where accurate real-time positional data is crucial,
 * such as in navigation apps, augmented reality platforms, and location-based services. The filter is designed
 * to be robust against errors inherent in individual sensors by fusing data from multiple sources and applying
 * mathematical models to predict and correct the system state dynamically.
 *
 * Example:
 * ExtendedKalmanFilter ekf = new ExtendedKalmanFilter();
 * ekf.predict(currentOrientation, stepSize, averageStepLength, System.currentTimeMillis(), userMovementType);
 * ekf.update(new double[]{sensorX, sensorY}, currentPenaltyFactor);
 * ekf.onStepDetected(detectedEast, detectedNorth, currentAltitude, System.currentTimeMillis());
